Created for the [Winter N64 Style Graphics Jam - itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/winter-n64-space-jam).



I tried my best to emulated a point and click game with pre-rendered background. Of course, everything is real time 3D and the illusion can be brake during cinematic, but for a first experience, I think I done OK. 

It was more a project to learn, so I tried to keep thing simple. I ended up oversimplified the game when I caught COVID. My intention were to add a lots of mini-game when combining object but I was to tired for that.



*Warning: your graphic card must be compatible with Vulkan Api to run the game*



## Controls

### Keyboard

`W A S D` to move (I used physical key input, so if it's W on QWERTY Layout(American), you can use Z on AZERTY Layout(French))

`Tab` or `i` open inventory

`space` to interact with environment

`escape`to pause



### Gamepad

`Left Stick` and `D-PAD` to move

`Top Action`, `Xbox Y`, `Sony Triangle`, `Nintendo X` to open inventory

`A` to interact with environment

`Start` to pause



## Tools

The game was made using `Godot 4 Beta-7` and `Godot 4 Beta-8`, beside some crash caused by the AnimationPlayer, the development was pretty straight forward.



Model were made with `Blender 3.3` and it's like the first time I model thing for a game, so I surely did a lot of thing wrong,
